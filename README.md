# Extra Gleam exercise: Fibonacci sequence

Charlie was asked to implement a `fib` function that returns the Nth
[Fibonacci number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence).

His implementation can be found in [`src/fib.gleam`](src/fib.gleam).

When calculating the 50th Fibonacci number, however, the algorithm starts
to get very slow.

Try to rewrite the algorithm in a more efficient way.

The solution can be found on the `solution` branch, but first try
to figure it out for yourself.
